# CS230_Final_Project

The Gaming Room client wants us to develop a web-based version of their android game "Draw it or Lose it".
The best work I did in the template is suggesting recommendation on what operating system is best suited for the development.
The resources in every module helped me to make the design template.
If I can revisit and do the design template again, I want to make a better job of doing the evaluation and explain it better.
I implemented all the requirements and features of the client because it's their product and know what they want from it. It's important to consider user's needs because they are the on using the product and know what needs improvement and consistency.
Software design template is helpful on what to focus on the project. I will apply this to my next personal projects and work.
